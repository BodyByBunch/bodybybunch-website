# Cursor AI Rules for Body By Bunch Project

## Package Manager Preference
- Always use `bun` or `bunx` when possible for package management and script execution
- Only fallback to `npm` or `npx` if bun commands fail
- Examples:
  - Use `bunx create-next-app` instead of `npx create-next-app`
  - Use `bun add` instead of `npm install`
  - Use `bun run` instead of `npm run`

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- This is a Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Uses shadcn/ui components and next-themes for dark/light mode
- Image assets go in `/public/images/` with organized subdirectories
- Components use barrel exports from `index.ts` files
- Theme-aware components should use CSS variables and Tailwind dark: prefixes
- Prefer component composition over monolithic components

## Git Workflow
- When user says "perfect, it is now working as expected" or "ok great, lets commit our changes" similar satisfaction phrases after fixing a bug or adding a feature, automatically run `git add .` and compose a descriptive commit message that summarizes the changes made
- Commit messages should follow conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore
- Include specific details about what was changed or fixed
- Update any relevant documentation (README, API docs, process docs) when changes affect public interfaces, workflows, or system behavior
